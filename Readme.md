### Experimental Wavetable Generator

Ok. Bear with me... This is experimental.

I was looking for a way to generate more experimental sounding wavetables from a bunch of audio files. The idea was to have Python select a random audio file, take a random sample starting point and create a 2048-samples long wavetable. 

1. Add a bunch of random audio files into the soundfiles folder ->
2. Just run the script ```generate_experimental_wavetables(Fs, num_tables)``` and specifiy the number of wavetables you want to generate (Num_Tables)! ->
3. Find the generated wavetable files in the output folder!

##### A Thought or 2 about Wavetables

Generating good sounding wavetables is a bit of an art form it seems. Some good tutorials can be found online -> [f.e. this one by Venus Theory](https://youtu.be/2JZ40UIUYTY?si=pYdC3y_wtSmiQ4yr)!
